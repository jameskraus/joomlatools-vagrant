Joomlatools Vagrant
=================

[Joomlatools Vagrant] automates the setup of a Joomla development environment. It is capable of running a full featured LAMP stack with a single command so that you can start working on your Joomla projects quickly.

Installation
------------

1. Install [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/)

1. Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)

1. Run the following commands in a folder of your choice:

    ```
    vagrant init joomlatools/box
    vagrant up
    ```

    This will download the Vagrant box and get it running.

1. Add the following line into your ***hosts file*** (/etc/hosts on Linux and MacOS, for other operating systems see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)#Location_in_the_file_system))

    ```
    33.33.33.58 joomla.box webgrind.joomla.box phpmyadmin.joomla.box
    ```

1. The dashboard is now available at [joomla.box](http://joomla.box)

There will be two new folders created called `www` and `Projects`. These folders act as shared folders between your host computer and the box.

Getting started
---------------

1. Once you have installed the box as described above, SSH into the box:

    ```
    vagrant ssh
    ```

1. Create your first Joomla website with this command:

    ```
    joomla site:create mysite
    ```

1. Your new site is available at [joomla.box/mysite](http://joomla.box/mysite). You can login using the credentials  `admin` / `admin`.

1. You can now symlink and install your custom extensions into the site, manage PHP versions and much more. Head over to our [documentation pages][Joomlatools Vagrant] to learn more about the box and its possibilities.

Updating to the latest version
------------------------------

When new versions of the box are released you can update your local machine by executing:

```
vagrant box update
```

Note that updating the box will not update an already-running Vagrant machine. To reflect the changes in the box, you will have to destroy (`vagrant destroy`) and bring back up the Vagrant machine (`vagrant up`).

For more details refer to our [FAQ](https://www.joomlatools.com/developer/tools/vagrant/faq/#how-can-i-update-the-box-to-the-latest-version).

Sharing access to the box
-------------------------

One of the great features of Vagrant is [Vagrant Share](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/share/index.html). Please note that Vagrant Share requires an account with [HashiCorp's Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/).

To share access, run this command and follow the instructions:

```
vagrant share --http 80
```

For more options please refer to the [Vagrant docs](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/share/index.html).

For hacking on the box
----------------------

If you want to make changes to the box's infrastructure, you can do so by building the box from scratch. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/joomlatools/joomlatools-vagrant.git
    ```

1. Install required Vagrant plugins

    ```
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-puppet-install
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
    ```

1. Go to the repository folder and provision the box:

    ```
    cd joomlatools-vagrant
    vagrant up
    ```

1. You can now edit the Puppet configuration. To apply your changes, provision the box again:

    ```
    vagrant provision
    ```

Building and releasing using Packer
-----------------------------------

We use [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) to automatically build and deploy the box on [Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/joomlatools/box). To launch a build, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/joomlatools/joomlatools-vagrant.git
    ```

1. Install [Packer](https://www.packer.io/)
1. Generate a new token for your [Atlas account](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/settings/tokens).
1. Make the token available to Packer in the current terminal session:

    ```
    export ATLAS_TOKEN=<token>
    ```

1. Now edit the `packer.json` file. Look for the current version and increase the version number.
The version number is defined in the post-processor section and can be found at the bottom of the file. It looks like this:

    ```js
    "post-processors": [
       ...
      {
          "type": "atlas",
          ...
          "metadata": {
              "provider": "virtualbox",
              "version": "1.4.3"
          }
      }]
    ]
    ```

    If you are not updating the `joomlatools/box` but want to create your own version, be sure to replace all occurences of `joomlatools/box` with your account and box name in the `packer.json` file.

    *Note* A build cannot overwrite an existing version. If you want to replace an existing version, you will have to delete it on Atlas first!
1. Also increase the `$box_version` variable in `puppet/manifests/default.pp` and update the changelog.
1. Commit the change and push back to GitHub.
1. Instruct packer to start the build:

    ```
    packer push packer.json
    ```

You can follow-up the build progress on the [Builds](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/builds) page. Once it's finished, the new version will be automatically available on the [your boxes](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/vagrant) section. Add a changelog and release it to the public.

Reporting issues
----------------

The box is a very complex piece of technology, based on many different open source tools and libraries many of which are far beyond our capabilities and understanding.

We therefore deliberately keep the Issues section on this specific Github repo closed as we want to encourage people to submit code to add features or fix bugs by opening up Pull Requests instead of report bug or problems through Issues.

If you do have a problem running the box please use either our [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/joomlatools-dev) or [chat room](http://gitter.im/joomlatools/dev) to get in touch with us and we are most happy to try and help you.
